In this individual Capstone Project, we were tasked to show off what we have learned in Level 1 Html and CSS.
I chose the recipe page to demonstrate what i have learned in Level 1.

Some of the skills I learnt were: 
1. How to setup an html boilerplate that set the foundation for my html webpage
2. I learnt how to link a CSS file to my html document.
3. I learnt how to comment my code so that it is easily understandable to myself and others.
4. I learnt typography hierarchy. Eg. H1 ----> H6
5. How to add a Hero image
6. CSS Box Model

I designed my recipe page as part of a Pro chef's mock website.
